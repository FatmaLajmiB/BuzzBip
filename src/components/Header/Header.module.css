/*
  CSS Modules are used for component-specific styles that are
  difficult or impossible to achieve purely with Tailwind utility classes.
  
  For this simple header, most styling is done with Tailwind.
  However, if you had complex animations, unique pseudo-elements,
  or very specific layouts that Tailwind doesn't directly support,
  you would define them here.

  Example: A custom animation for the logo on hover.
*/
.logoAnimation:hover {
  transform: rotate(5deg) scale(1.05);
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/*
  You could also define custom component-level classes here
  that use your custom CSS variables (from globals.css)
  or even raw hex codes if they are truly unique to this component.
*/
.custom-header-background {
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* A color not in your theme, specific to this header */
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}

/*
  Remember: When you define a class here, it gets "scoped" automatically
  by Next.js (or your build tool). So, `.logoAnimation` becomes something
  like `Header_logoAnimation__xyz123` in the final CSS, preventing conflicts.
